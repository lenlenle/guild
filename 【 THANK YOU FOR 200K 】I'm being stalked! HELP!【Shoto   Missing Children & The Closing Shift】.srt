00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,167
Whenever I'm working a little anxious hugging my pillow that makes me feel a little bit better

141
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
But all I saw someone drew like this fan are over

142
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
Me hugging or Vox hugging me and that made me feel a lot better

143
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,943

The game

149
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Missing children

150
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Here it is

151
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407

Okay I guess I'm keeping the dog ears on for the stream like sometime

To put it simply

204
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
Three Junior High School students went missing

205
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
But

206
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
We're suspecting. It's not a case of kidnapping

207
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,568
One of the kids parents overheard their conversation of meeting up on the TV went missing

208
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
Awesomeness you should be able to help you out

217
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984

Forget his face

235
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,520
Not really a detective I mostly just help out struggling kids in schools

236
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
And people start calling you a boy Detective

237
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,688
Whatever it is I find it very hard to trust a woman who looks so

238
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
Real take on a mission like this Q

Senpai

Do I have the letter now or know she probably took the letter f***

592
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Okay

00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,143
Wait I want to read the letter again because like I want to make sure like

594
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:08,543
It was cheese on that forged it was what do you guys think that she right or is that actually I'm pretty sure

595
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,151
The mom wrote the letter so like a f*** with the piano

596
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
That's weird

597
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
Really weird

598
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:28,511
Alright well we have a box of masks maybe the kid with the masks would like it right because

599
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
He seems.

600
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
There's an elected office and if not then damn I have no f****** idea maybe the kid maybe the other kid with the dog food

601
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,335
Would trade it masks for the dog food I don't know

602
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,295
Yeah I don't like it when parents are very

603
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:57,951
I don't like it when parents I govern your relationships like that like

604
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:04,351
You know like they don't want you to hang out with certain people and stuff like that like I remember my mom didn't want me to hang out

605
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:10,751
I was like two people I still talk to stay from for my college right because they

606
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:17,151
She was like there going to be a bad influence since they Gon Party so much or whatever like that but they are some of the smartest wise

607
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:23,551
People I've met in my entire life inside it's like you can't really judge somebody by like money or

608
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
Or like a Luxor to all that Cyprus up there answer so I don't know I think it's traditional

609
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:36,351
Like that it's super annoying but you guys get what I mean by you know those

610
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:40,959
To judge a person so quickly like that

611
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,519
It's just so artificial I don't like that

612
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Thanks

613
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407

00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943

Where'd you like to go yourselves that you're a bad influence trust me I feel like I was also

620
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:26,015
One of those kids that parents moved in like don't hang out with shell tall he's a bad influence he curses

621
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:32,415
So much he he's off now you like stuck in trouble and all that stuff I like

622
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
Y'all f*** you you would want to but you know I just think their moms are jealous because they can't be my friend

623
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,911
That's why I told myself when I was younger

624
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
Connie's house okay

625
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
I'm about to okay I was kind of a Rowdy boy when I was younger like I didn't have much self-control

626
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
I remember in kindergarten and saw first grade I was I had like a lot of

627
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:05,951
Write-ups on my calendar so how it works is that up

628
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
Pause real quick

629
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
She know I don't need to pause

630
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
Docking kindergarten I used to have a this calendar or my teachers would write sound like notes

631
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,871
For the day if I was like a good if I was like a behaved well right it would put a sticker on the day that I

632
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:29,503
Did really well and then other days they would have like a a red mark that I did really badly right

633
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,903
And then most of the time I had a lot of red marks because I haven't had a problem with self-control I was really like rowdy

634
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,975
I like to cause trouble I like seeing you know

635
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:44,095
Pick fights I guess they're like you know I don't know

636
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:48,191

00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
Bro

676
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
He's probably desperate for money yeah I feel like a lot of places do you have an issue of like you know the

677
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
Old people population in like

678
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Dumb

679
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
Making money in

680
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,599
Being homeless and stuff and I feel feels bad

681
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,927
I know it's an issue in Korea right

682
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
Kind of reminds me of that

683
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,631
Like people are now desperate for money and they got to make a deal with what they can

684
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:32,287
That's how my parents are used to be

685
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,871
You like that I don't want to be I don't want to be

686
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
You know

687
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:42,783
Or see anybody in my family that saw saw freeze like that it'll just make me sad

688
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:52,511
I think that's one of my fears actually in life I think a lot of people have that fear just being like a you know living on the streets

689
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,607
Being cold without a bed

690
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,935
I know like home-cooked meals that's really sad

691
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
No one's home

692
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:10,431
Are my parents from my parents actually moved over to the United States

693
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,759

00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,927
So they they drew up with very little and Zoe and I worked really hard 200

695
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:28,095
Yeah I saw me going out with my parents is really rough it wasn't easy

696
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
Ansel

697
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
It was really really a sucky

698
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,519

Although there is no meaning it's just gibberish

01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,199

That was upset about Mom buying a back online

987
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,599
Why can't you reward herself once in awhile

988
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:40,767
See this is what I'm talking about my my parents are upset when I like like to treat myself sometimes right

989
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:47,167
I like sometimes I'm like I spend $10 on the on the snack or like maybe by myself a

990
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
And my mom is like

991
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:54,591
Shelter stop spending so much money on this job I'm like but I made it myself

992
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Venza

993
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,175
I thought I want to treat myself mom

994
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
You know

995
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:07,903
I don't get it I just it's very stupid it's okay to treat yourself guys alright

996
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
Remember

997
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:14,047
Never says anything otherwise you should remember it just do even more

998
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,375
Even more is an Asian thing yeah I guess it is an Asian thing

999
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
Or an ethnic thing

1000
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Okay

1001
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
Mom has allowed on this time around

1002
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,871
I've been drinking Riesling is wasting money for god-knows-what

1003
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,967
Inside me some excuse about how it's not fun coming back home and Health Center space

1004
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,015
What is going on

1005
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,903
Today's my birthday and now they're my parents remember it

1006
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,463
Not even a single word of Celebration

1007
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,255
Thing is always

1008
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,303
I'm getting sick of it

1009
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,399
Thinking is that they were angry because my failing grades

1010
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,983
That's been on the steady decline I still can pass

1011
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,031
I'm just below the average

1012
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,359
All I want is a reason to fight and complain about each other

1013
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,455
So that really sucked like

1014
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
I would not like you know

1015
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
Forgetting someone's birthday

1016
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,879
And that's something to celebrate

1017
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,207
I feel you kid I feel you

1018
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
Never gets tired of fighting

1019
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,583
I feel as if I don't have a home

1020
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:23,423
I start to lock myself up in my room every time one of them comes back

1021
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,727
I want to hear their voices anymore

1022
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
Every night I wish my life was

1023
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
Little happier

1024
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,383
Just a little is fine

1025
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,479
Today's fight with something else

1026
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,039
I overheard something I shouldn't have

1027
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,111
They said they wouldn't be here together if I weren't born

1028
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,439
He also said that I was born before they married

1029
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
I'm sure that's what they said

1030
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,071
Come they never talked to me about it

1031
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,119
I feel unwanted

1032
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,655
I should exist

1033
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,471
I don't feel right to be in this world

1034
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
I want to hide to keep on a piece of furniture again but

1035
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,151
I didn't set my color this time

1036
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,455
Just so I don't forget

1037
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
Write this down

1038
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
Biscuits

1039

Music you said that I should let the dog handle the hiding but

1040
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
Watch the dog

1041
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
Why trust a dog

1042
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,999
Watches with dogs are so nice in

1043
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,791
3rd gear fluffy in

1044
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071

01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,272
Matter was not too big to not taking to my own hands

1191

1202
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,016

1203
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,064

1211
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:44,352
I'm not sure we're supposed to put it though I think it sucks

1212
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424

Trine the kid doesn't have a need for the windmills

1219
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,776

Savings America recently decided to keep things in EDT from now on right we're not going to be

1263
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:55,232
Changing off like after this recent daylight savings or not moving the clocks anymore for summer

1264
01:34:55,488 --> 01:35:01,632
I think that's pretty cool so I don't have to like deal with what sunsets

So I don't know how that's going to work but I'm excited

1267
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:20,832
Not to worry about Daylight Saving stuff anymore so do other people not to worry about it either since I know it's kind of

1268
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:27,232
Confusing for the rest of the world is sometimes that we are now in

1269
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:33,632

I'm so glad I found them

1277
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
Took a breather and left the park

1278
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,664
After the incident I decide to keep in touch with the girls Avella Oculus bully situation

1279
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,064
I contacted the parents in the school it seems like they found evidence of bullying

1280
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:30,464
Nice at the bowling ends entirely from there I also called 189 to report child neglect sunakhi owner

Temporary custody things happen so suddenly how could go often tells me

1285
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:55,296
She says that she still meet up for her dad often

1286
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:01,952

1289
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:21,152
I want s'more known that there was a misunderstanding has been resolved now they're in the process of persuading her mother

1290
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:27,552
Be long before the mother accepts them I couldn't save my son talk to me then

1291
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:33,952
He's no longer here how many times have I told myself. But the truth is he's

1292
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:39,584
Then there was me all along thanks to talk to me I was able to find these people I'm certain

1293
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,400

Earlier I had to adjust the settings so that's why there's a continue game file

1326
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,208
I like to adjust the options beforehand

1327
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,024
Okay let's see

1328
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,192

Maybe

1342
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,640
Chinchilla

1343
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,688

The game is chinchilla base

1347
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:51,232
Like how we can see our legs in our arms found out

1348
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:54,304

Business lady

1351
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:01,216
All this is one of those is this like one of those tiny Apartments

1352
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
Like

1353
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:08,896
I've never been in one of these like we have a bed and we can climb up to and is like the bathroom and kitchen

1354
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,432
Probably and there's like

1355
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,736
Living room area

1356
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:21,952
Yeah it's a really tiny apartment I don't think I could live in one of these though it looks cozy by the same time like

1357
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,792
Play Weezer

1358
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,864
Oh here's your kitchen this is such a small kitchen though

1359
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,656
Are you going to do all your cooking

1360
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:39,360
It's kind of cozy looking to be honest yeah like there's a bathroom

1361
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:43,200
Is there a very tiny boil it works right

1362
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,272
I'm guessing this is like common in Japan

1363
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,624
I need more room though for like a my

1364
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:54,976
Like my computer and all that stuff so I don't think I could live in a place like this

1365
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:55,744
Do all

1366
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,328

1367
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:14,688

01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:27,488
They announced that they were coming out with this and I saw like the concepts for the game I was really excited I couldn't wait for it to come out

1370
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:33,888
Smiley out flashlight

1371
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:40,288
Is it morning time or is it like nighttime Frost right now it looks like it's off

1372
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:46,688

01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:12,288
Tired right now I just I just talk like this

1376
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:25,088
Someone's phone okay while we picked up somebody's phone I guess all right

1377
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:31,488
Also let me know if it's too dark maybe I can adjust the brightness a bit

1378
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:37,888
You guys can see better that's not too harsh on the eyes

1379

1381
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:57,088
Deja Salter does definitely make it look a little bit more

1382
01:44:57,344 --> 01:45:03,488

Names that are really funny alright I don't really like Pepsi

1387
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:35,488
I think if there is off but there's a soda that would drink is Coca-Cola but I don't really

1388
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:41,888
Minnesota that often anyways I don't really consider that these days to be honest and saw love sugar

1389
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:48,288
But there's one asking it's Coca-Cola because I'm

1390
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:54,688
Those are really nice and sweet and then Pepsi is just kind of like you know medicine medicinal tasting in the way

1391
01:45:54,944 --> 01:46:01,088
Some people like that

1392
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:07,488

1829
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:51,904
We're going to find somebody in our house that's the kind of level of all freekesha I'm expecting right now

Maybe she was actually a nice guy I don't know maybe I'm driving too fast but

02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:40,800
Like super super young I would hate closing shift because it's just a lot of work at the end

1837
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:47,200
Feel like morning and midday is a lot better

1838

Didn't expect that I really didn't expect him to say that by the way

1907
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:07,104
I didn't think that because I'm not around some something about the store

1908
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:08,896
Maybe because of that guy over there

1909

02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:21,440

02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:56,768
Like actual Killers murderers and like kidnappers

1918
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,560
Real people are

1919
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:04,960
A thousand times more scary than like an alien or like I don't know

1920
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:07,264
I'll f****** Pyramid Head

1921
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,080

1922
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:13,920
You know or scp's those guys they're pretty scary right

02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:15,968
You know

1925
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:20,064
People that are literal stalkers

1926
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,856
And thought

1927
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:26,976
You know tractors all that type of stuff that's really what gets Maya

1928
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:28,256
You know

1929
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:33,376
It's me and not for your spot self I think this game is trying to appeal more to that rather than like ghosts

1930
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:35,424
And like spirits

1931
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,728
So I think that's kind of cool you know

1932
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,824
So far I feel like the theme right now is that we're exploring

1933
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:43,872
Jewel

1934
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,152
People

1935
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:46,688
Being like a threat

1936
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:52,320
To us rather than like spirits and demons of chemical

1937
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,368
Alright so long

1938
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:56,672

I hope it doesn't affect my ending on the mooer here so you guys can see what the options are

2617
03:23:38,367 --> 03:23:39,135

03:23:39,391 --> 03:23:40,671

2619
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:43,999

Open closet haven't post on Tik-Tok in a while now

2637
03:24:56,959 --> 03:25:02,335

Salted caramel mocha while she crying

2821
03:40:13,951 --> 03:40:15,231

2822
03:40:17,279 --> 03:40:20,095

2826
03:40:37,247 --> 03:40:38,527
Baby Gone Gone

2827
03:40:39,551 --> 03:40:44,159
So why she still walking around with the carriage all

2828
03:40:48,255 --> 03:40:50,815
That sucks

2829
03:40:53,631 --> 03:40:58,239
That's kind of creepy though maybe we're hallucinating I'm not sure

2830
03:41:04,383 --> 03:41:05,663
Yeah that's all

2831
03:41:06,687 --> 03:41:10,527
We'll see what happens I feel like there might be some things were missing

2832
03:41:11,295 --> 03:41:14,367
Like contact conceptually we're missing some stuff right

2833
03:41:18,975 --> 03:41:25,119

2834
03:41:25,887 --> 03:41:29,471

03:41:42,783 --> 03:41:45,855
Red beans and butter bread

2839
03:41:46,111 --> 03:41:50,207
I'll do the store real fast and then I'll do the other drinks

2840
03:41:50,975 --> 03:41:57,119
Honestly though whoever said it is right this is a lot like slower than usual

2841
03:41:57,375 --> 03:42:03,263
Bariachi Lazard game I'm not too sure why but I mean I do like the pace it's

2842
03:42:03,775 --> 03:42:04,543
Going nuts

2843
03:42:07,871 --> 03:42:12,735
And there's different ends it's like slowly building up the

2844
03:42:14,783 --> 03:42:16,831
Four aspect of it all but

2845
03:42:18,111 --> 03:42:22,719
I mean I feel safe now I think since we all have our friend around right

2846
03:42:23,743 --> 03:42:26,047
We cannot put the Skins milk in

2847
03:42:30,143 --> 03:42:32,447
Michigan

Now I think I did it right

2851
03:42:43,967 --> 03:42:44,991
Want to talk

2852
03:42:47,551 --> 03:42:51,647

2861
03:43:22,623 --> 03:43:24,671

2871
03:43:59,743 --> 03:44:03,071
Could be the investigator maybe I should check it out

2872

04:06:22,463 --> 04:06:23,743

3045
04:06:24,255 --> 04:06:25,279
Call the owner

3046
04:06:34,751 --> 04:06:35,519
Where's my phone

3047
04:06:44,479 --> 04:06:45,759
God really

3048
04:07:06,495 --> 04:07:07,263
He has it

3049
04:07:12,895 --> 04:07:18,527
Oh no bro it's outside I don't want to go outside

3050

3051
04:07:25,439 --> 04:07:30,559
New phone just got a new phone it's okay

3052
04:07:32,863 --> 04:07:39,007
God we're gang baited rigging beat it's so hard

3053
04:07:39,263 --> 04:07:45,407
Why are we letting this happen

3054
04:07:52,063 --> 04:07:58,207
Yikes snowman please no

3055
04:07:58,463 --> 04:08:04,607
Next to the car to

3056
04:08:11,263 --> 04:08:17,407
I think he's inside our apartment now

3057
04:08:17,663 --> 04:08:23,807
Eyes we got our phone but

3058
04:08:24,063 --> 04:08:30,207
I don't want to walk back up to the apartment he's inside

3059
04:08:30,463 --> 04:08:36,607
Oh my God

3060
04:08:56,063 --> 04:08:57,855
Oh no

3061
04:09:17,311 --> 04:09:23,455
We really just still losing

3062
04:09:23,711 --> 04:09:29,855
In the end

3063
04:09:36,511 --> 04:09:42,655
I can't believe this I feel cheated man

3064
04:09:42,911 --> 04:09:49,055
We work so hard to see live with a brick like throw into his head

3065
04:09:49,311 --> 04:09:55,455
I got your back I just built different

3066
04:09:55,711 --> 04:10:01,855
I don't know how you lived I was a heavy Bricks Young Man

3067
04:10:02,111 --> 04:10:08,255
Would you live how did he live

3068
04:10:08,511 --> 04:10:14,655
Well I thought guys

3069
04:10:14,911 --> 04:10:21,055
I mean that was a really good game

3070
04:10:21,311 --> 04:10:27,455
I like a lot a lot of envelopes you much. Coffee making about the same time

3071
04:10:27,711 --> 04:10:33,855
Is really terrifying staff to deal with the

3072
04:10:34,111 --> 04:10:40,255
Weird Al showing up every now and then and creeping around knowing you lived in the stuff

3073
04:10:40,511 --> 04:10:46,655
Around the other area where the coffee was stored that's so weird

3074
04:10:46,911 --> 04:10:53,055
I had a feeling sooner because that door was locked the entire time and it didn't even let us know

3075
04:10:53,311 --> 04:10:59,455
No like what was behind her the movie Think Like there has to be something secretive back there involving that

3076
04:10:59,711 --> 04:11:04,831
Your stalker

3077
04:11:05,087 --> 04:11:06,623
That was a good game

3078
04:11:06,879 --> 04:11:13,023
I like that a lot you found washable thank you

3079
04:11:13,279 --> 04:11:19,423
Oh my God is that mean I'm I'm like certified to be a barista now

3080
04:11:19,679 --> 04:11:25,823
I can I can work out a Starbucks going for an hour right

3081
04:11:26,079 --> 04:11:32,223
Why does my training training montage

3082
04:11:32,479 --> 04:11:38,623
But it's no I hadn't

3083
04:11:38,879 --> 04:11:45,023
Nice times in that little I don't know it was kind of like a cafe simulator

3084
04:11:45,791 --> 04:11:46,559
Type of thing

3085
04:11:48,351 --> 04:11:51,935
Mixed in with all the horror elements all Android it

3086
04:11:52,191 --> 04:11:53,215
Had a fun time

3087
04:11:54,239 --> 04:11:55,007
Allow

3088
04:11:55,775 --> 04:11:56,543
House creepy

3089
04:11:58,591 --> 04:12:00,895
I think the biggest jump-scare though

3090
04:12:01,407 --> 04:12:07,551
The biggest jump scare the entire time was the f****** lady with the baby carriage and she just showed up

3091
04:12:08,063 --> 04:12:12,159
Just tell me to watch where I was going. I don't think anything else scared me more than that

3092
04:12:13,439 --> 04:12:19,327
Is everything else was kind of like I expected it to happen then the f****** on C baby carriage

3093
04:12:19,839 --> 04:12:21,887
It was known that really got me out of everything

3094
04:12:22,399 --> 04:12:23,423
Sad

3095
04:12:29,055 --> 04:12:32,383
