beforehand that's why maya my heart is

511
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,679
second at the moment but that's not just

512

because of you guys obviously i mean you

513
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200

i've never done anything like this

the raven

1435
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:27,360
let's see

1436
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,679
once upon a been night dreary while i

1437
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,920
pondered weak and weary over many

1438
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,960
acquainting curious volume of forgotten

1439
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,120
lore

1440
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,520
while i nodded in nearly napping

1441
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:40,639
suddenly there came a tapping

1442
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:42,320
as of someone gently rapping rapping at

1443
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:45,040
my chamber door

1444
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:48,000
tis some visitor i muttered tapping at

1445
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:49,920
my chamber door only this and nothing

1446
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,800
more

1447
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:55,040
ah distinctly i remember

1448
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,440
it was in the bleak december

1449
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,679
and each separate dying ember

1450
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:03,600
wrought its ghost upon the floor

1451
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:04,880
eagerly i wish tomorrow if inly i sought

1452
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,320
to borrow

1453
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,159
from my books

1454
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,120
cersei's of sorrow

1455
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:13,840
sorrow for the lost lenore

1456
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:15,840
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the

1457
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:19,040
angels named lenore

1458
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,800
nameless here forevermore

1459
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:23,199
and this silken sad

1460
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,320
uncertain rustling of each purple

1461
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,520
curtain

1462
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,159
thrilled me

1463
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,920
filled me with fantastic terrors never

1464
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,280
felt before

1465
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,840
so that now

1466
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,120
to steal the beating of my heart i stood

1467
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,800
repeating

1468
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,159
to some visitor

1469
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,639
entreating

1470
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:43,199
entrance at my chamber door

1471
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,800
some laid visitor entreating entrance at

1472
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:46,000
my chamber door

1473
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,800
that it is

1474
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,440
and nothing more

1475
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:54,960
presently my soul grew stronger

1476
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:57,199
hesitating than no longer sir

1477
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,840
said i or madam

1478
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:02,159
truly your forgiveness i implore

1479
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,719
but the fact is i was napping

1480
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:07,679
and so gently you came rapping

1481
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:10,000
and so faintly you came tapping

1482
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:12,639
tapping at my chamber door

1483
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,719
that i scarce was sure i heard you

1484
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:18,400
here i opened wide the door

1485
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:20,880
darkness there and nothing more

1486
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:23,520
deep into that darkness peering

1487
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,639
long i stood there wondering fearing

1488
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,280
doubting

1489
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,800
dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to

1490
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:31,600
dream before

1491
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,440
but the silence was unbroken

1492
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,440
in the stillness

1493
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:38,000
gave no token

1494
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:40,800
and the only word there spoken

1495
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,159
was the whispered word lenore

1496
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:46,560
this i whispered and an echo murmured

1497
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,840
back the word lenore

1498
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,159
merely this and nothing

1499
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,880
more back into the chamber turning all

1500
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:57,600
my soul within me burning

1501
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:00,159
soon again i heard a tapping

1502
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,679
so much louder than before

1503
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,000
surely said i

1504
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,960
surely that is something at my window

1505
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,560
lattice

1506
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,639
let me see then what theoretics is

1507
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,440
in this mystery explore

1508
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:16,560
let my heart be still a moment

1509
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:20,560
in this mystery explore

1510
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,560
test the wind and nothing more

1511
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:25,120
open here

1512
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:28,560
i flung the shutter

1513
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:31,280
one with many a flirting flutter

1514
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,320
in the stepped a stately raven

1515
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:37,440
of the saintly days of yore

1516
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:40,719
not the least obese made he

1517
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:43,280
not a minute stopped or stayed he

1518
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:46,159
but with mine of lord or lady

1519
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:48,880
perched above my chamber door preached

1520
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:51,360
upon a bust of palace

1521
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,400
just above my chamber door

1522
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:57,840
perched and sat and nothing more

1523
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:59,679
then this ebony bird big girling my sad

1524
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,239
fancy into smiling

1525
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:04,639
by the grave and stern decorum of the

1526
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:07,679
countenance it wore

1527
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:11,199
though thy crest be shorn and shaven

1528
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:13,679
thou i said are to sure no craven

1529
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:16,159
ghastly grim an ancient raven

1530
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:18,400
wandering from the nightly shore

1531
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:21,520
tell me what thy lordly name

1532
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,360
is on the night's plutonian shore

1533

much i marveled this ungainly fowl to

1536
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:33,280
hear discourse so plainly

1537
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:36,000
though its answer little meaning

1538
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:38,960
little relevancy bore

1539
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,120
for we cannot help agreeing

1540
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:44,719
that no living human being

1541
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:46,800
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird

1542
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,159
above his chamber door

1543
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,080
bird or beast

1544
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:51,840
such a sculptured bust

1545
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,360
above his chamber door

1546
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,679
with such name

1547
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,639
as never more

1548
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:01,199
but the raven sitting lonely on the

1549
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:04,159
placid bust spoke only

1550
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:06,960
that one word as of his soul and that's

1551
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:08,560
one word he did outpour

1552
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,360
nothing farther

1553
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,800
than he uttered not a feather

1554
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,840
then he fluttered

1555
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,280
till i scarcely more than muttered

1556
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,760
other friends

1557
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,760

1558
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,920
ah

1559
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:29,840
sorry about that i needed to drink some

1560

more tea

1561
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,960

01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:39,760
on the morrow he will leave me

1564
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:42,400
as my hopes have flown before then the

1565
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:45,280
bird said nevermore

1566
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:48,159
started at the stillness broken by reply

1567
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,600
sold aptly spoken doubtless said i

1568
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:52,880
what did others

1569
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:56,320
is only stock in store caught from some

1570
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:58,800
unhappy master who on merciful disaster

1571
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:00,960
followed fast and followed faster till

1572
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,440
his songs one burden bore

1573
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:05,280
till the durges of his hope that

1574
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,199
melancholy burden bore

01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:09,760

i think i will stop for there uh

1578
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,159
